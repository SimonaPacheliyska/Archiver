                              This project is part of the Data Structures and Algorithms Course
                              
 The project generates a binary file that contains compressed data which is located in a given directory. The binary file contains the names of all the folders and subfolders of the parent directory and also contains their data. The Archiver reduces the size of the data almost 8 times. Supported commands : 
 
-compress pathToAFileOrDirectory;

-add pathToAnExcistingArchive;

-list pathToAnExcistingArchive;

-extract pathToAnExcistingArchive.

All the compressed folders will be restored after extracting the archive
