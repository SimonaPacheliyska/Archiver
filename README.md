This project is part of the Data Structures and Algorithms Course
                              
   The project generates a binary file that contains compressed data which is located in a given directory. The binary file contains the names of all the folders and subfolders of the parent directory and also contains their data. The Archiver reduces the size of the data almost 8 times. 
 Supported commands : 
 
-compress <"path to a file or a directory">;

-add <"path to an existing archive">;

-list <"path to an excisting archive>">;

-extract <"path to an existing archive">.

All the compressed folders will be restored after extracting the archive
